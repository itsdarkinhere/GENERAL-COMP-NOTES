A Content Delivery Network (CDN) consists of several servers that are placed in strategic geographic locations. 
You can store copies of your website on them so its pages can be quickly loaded by users who are located far away from your main server.

What are containers?

Containers are a lighter-weight, more agile way of handling virtualization — since they don't use a hypervisor, 
you can enjoy faster resource provisioning and speedier availability of new applications. 

Rather than spinning up an entire virtual machine, containerization packages together everything needed to run a single application or microservice (along with runtime libraries they need to run). 
The container includes all the code, its dependencies and even the operating system itself. 
This enables applications to run almost anywhere — a desktop computer, a traditional IT infrastructure or the cloud.



In traditional virtualization, a hypervisor virtualizes physical hardware. 
The result is that each virtual machine contains a guest OS, a virtual copy of the hardware that the OS requires to run and an application and its associated libraries and dependencies. VMs with different operating systems can be run on the same physical server. 
For example, a VMware VM can run next to a Linux VM, which runs next to a Microsoft VM, etc.
