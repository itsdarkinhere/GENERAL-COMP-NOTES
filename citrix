Intro 

Hi myself Pranav I have completed my graduation in computer engineering in 2020
From Karmaveer Bhaurao Patil College of Engineering.
And I have been  working as cloud engineer since past 1 yr 10 months
Actually I was bit interested into cloud technology from college itself and as I had done cloud certs in college I got my first opportunity after passing out which was in company named searce 

I competed in the Google Cloud Dev Championship and was ranked 135th.




At Searce as a cloud engineer my work here is to deploy the applications of the various organizations on the cloud 


Putting websites to monitoring Patching servers, setting up cron jobs 

And as searce was msp with google cloud  for infrastructure I was also responsible for Handling and troubleshooting the various errors received from clients 

So much of infra side problems  of googles clients were routed to us and then we used to troubleshoot it and if it was unsolvable by us 
we would solve the ticket with google team and assists the client 



After Leaving Searce I joined Dassault Systemes and my current work here is 

Work Related 


Deployment and Automation in cloud environments.i have used 
python  modules such as  pyauto gui bit of selenium have Worked on our in-house tools automation 




We have different 3ds services which customers use, my role in here to assess these services I get a service referential from developer in which cloud architecture of the service is present 

And then I need to check the working of the service according to the cloud architecture , deploy the service, Check the working of the vms , perform operations on vms such as backup restore ,failover:master slave, scale H, scale volume ,scale storage, rolling upgrade of vms, relocate service 

monitoring part of those vms  


So we have container based services and vm based services on cloud.
So we have container farm created for paas services and in here we deploy all of these container services
And  We use this container farm as Kubernetes cluster and the services deployed in it acts as pods so it becomes easy for us to manage it 

Also we have And vm based services that we deploy it on aws and ows region
